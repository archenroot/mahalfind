Color Filtering with Mahalanobis Distance
=========================================

This is a tiny library for detecting objects with different colors based on the covariance of their training image, and a given mahalanobis distance threshold.

"Mahalanobis distance is used to identify and gauge similarity of an unknown sample set (i.e. captured picture / video frame)  to a known one (i.e. the training image)." [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance].
